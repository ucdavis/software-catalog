# Web App Template

A full-stack web application template featuring a .NET 8 backend with React/Vite frontend, using OIDC authentication with Microsoft Entra ID.

## Architecture

- **Backend**: .NET 8 Web API with ASP.NET Core
- **Frontend**: React 19 with Vite, TypeScript, and TanStack Router/Query/Table
- **Authentication**: OIDC with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Development**: Hot reload for both frontend and backend

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ucdavis/web-app-template/
   cd web-app-template
   ```

2. **Open In DevContainer**

   - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
   - Click the prompt to open in container (or manually select from the command palette).

_Using the DevContainer is optional, but it will get you the right version of dotnet + node, plus install all dependencies and setup a local SQL instance for you_

3. **Start the application**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This command automatically installs dependencies (if needed) and starts both the .NET backend and Vite frontend with hot reload enabled.

   _Optional: If dependencies change, you can manually reinstall with `npm install && cd client && npm install && cd ..` but you shouldn't have to, the `npm start` should handle it._

4. **Access the application**

The application will auto launch in your browser (to http://localhost:5173).

If you want to access endpoints individually, you can do so at the following URLs:

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:5165 (nothing to see, but /api/\* has the direct API endpoints)
- API Documentation (Swagger): http://localhost:5165/swagger/index.html
- Health check: http://localhost:5165/health

### Database configuration

The backend requires a SQL Server connection string. By default `appsettings.Development.json` has a connection string configured for the local SQL Server instance.

When you want to specify your own DB connection, provide it by setting the `DB_CONNECTION` environment variable (for example in a `.env` file) or by updating `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` in `appsettings.*.json` (`.env` is recommended)

### Auth Configuration

We use OIDC with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) for authentication. The auth flow doesn't use any secrets and the settings in `appsettings.*.json` are sufficient for local development.

When you are ready to get your own, go to [Microsoft Entra ID](https://entra.microsoft.com/) and create a new application registration. Set the redirect url to `http://localhost:5165/signin-oidc` and check the box for "ID tokens".

You might also want to set the publisher domain to ucdavis.edu and fill in the other general branding info.

### Health check

The health check endpoint (`/health`) is configured to return the status of the application and its dependencies. It includes a database health check to ensure the SQL Server connection is healthy. See [Health Checks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/health-checks?view=aspnetcore-9.0#entity-framework-core-dbcontext-probe).

## Development

### Backend Development

The backend is configured with hot reload via `dotnet watch`. Any changes to C# files will automatically restart the server.

### Frontend Development

The frontend uses Vite's hot module replacement (HMR). Changes to React components, TypeScript files, and CSS will be reflected immediately.

### Authentication Flow

1. Frontend routes requiring authentication redirect to the backend's login endpoint
2. Backend handles OIDC flow with Microsoft Entra ID
3. Upon successful authentication, a same-site cookie is set
4. Frontend API calls automatically include the authentication cookie
5. Backend validates the cookie for protected endpoints

## Testing

### Client tests

- Run `cd client && npm test` to execute the Vitest suite once.
- Use `npm run test:watch` inside `client/` for red/green feedback while you work.
- Tests run against a jsdom environment with Testing Library so you do not need the backend running.

### Server tests

- Run `dotnet test` from the repository root to execute the .NET test project included in `app.sln`.
- Alternatively, target the project directly with `dotnet test tests/server.tests/server.tests.csproj`.
- The tests use EF Core's in-memory provider (see `tests/server.tests/TestDbContextFactory.cs`) so no SQL Server instance is required.
